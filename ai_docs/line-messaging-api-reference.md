# Messaging API reference

## Common specifications 

Common specifications for Messaging API, such as the domain name of endpoints, response when a request succeeds or fails, and rate limit.

- [Domain name](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#domain-name)
- [Rate limits](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#rate-limits)
- [Status codes](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#status-codes)
- [Response headers](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#response-headers)
- [Error responses](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#error-responses)
- [Other common specifications](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#other-common-specifications)

### Domain name 

In Messaging API, the domain name differs depending on the endpoint. Be careful to use the correct domain name for each endpoint.

| Domain name | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| `api-data.line.me` | <ul><li>[Get content](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-content)</li><li>[Create audience for uploading user IDs (by file)](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#create-upload-audience-group-by-file)</li><li>[Add user IDs or Identifiers for Advertisers (IFAs) to an audience for uploading user IDs (by file)](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#update-upload-audience-group-by-file)</li><li>[Upload rich menu image](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#upload-rich-menu-image)</li><li>[Download rich menu image](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#download-rich-menu-image)</li></ul> |
| `api.line.me` | Other API endpoints |

### Rate limits 

The Messaging API applies the following rate limits for each API function (endpoint) on a per-channel. For more information about the scope of rate limits apply, see [Scope of rate limits](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#rate-limits-scope).

<!-- note start -->

**Don't submit requests exceeding the rate limit**

If you send requests exceeding the rate limit, you will receive an error message saying, `429 Too Many Requests`. When developing a LINE Bot using the Messaging API, follow the [Messaging API development guidelines](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/development-guidelines/), including the guidelines on rate limits.

<!-- note end -->

\* Creating and deleting rich menus using the [LINE Official Account Manager](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#line-oa-manager) is not subject to this restriction.

#### Scope of rate limits 

The Messaging API applies rate limits for each API function (endpoint) on a per-channel. Note also the following points about the scope of rate limits:

- Even if the endpoint URL is the same, it is a different endpoint if the HTTP method is different.
- We apply rate limits without distinguishing between the value of parameters in the URL or the contents of the request body.
- We apply rate limits without distinction, even if you use the endpoint from a different IP address.
- If you use endpoints for the same LINE Official Account from different channels, we'll apply rate limits independently for each channel.

#### Limit on the number of concurrent operations 

We have set a limit on the number of concurrent endpoint operations per audience ID (`audienceGroupId`), for creating an audience for uploading user IDs and adding user IDs to an audience.

The total number of requests processed concurrently by the following endpoints is counted as the number of concurrent operations.

| Endpoint | Maximum number of </br > concurrent operations |
| --- | --- |
| <ul><li>[Create audience for uploading user IDs (by JSON)](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#create-upload-audience-group)</li><li>[Create audience for uploading user IDs (by file)](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#create-upload-audience-group-by-file)</li><li>[Add user IDs or Identifiers for Advertisers (IFAs) to an audience for uploading user IDs (by JSON)](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#update-upload-audience-group)</li><li>[Add user IDs or Identifiers for Advertisers (IFAs) to an audience for uploading user IDs (by file)](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#update-upload-audience-group-by-file)</li></ul> | 10 |

Requests that exceed the limit on the number of concurrent operations will return an error with [status code](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#status-codes) `429 Too Many Requests`. If you've received an error, wait a while before making a request again.

You can check the number of requests being processed with the `jobs` property of the following endpoint response. If the status of a job (`jobs[].jobStatus` property) is waiting to run (`QUEUED`) or running (`WORKING`), it will be counted as an operation.

- [Get audience data](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-audience-group)

### Status codes 

These HTTP status codes are returned after an API call. We follow the [HTTP status code specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6) unless otherwise stated.

| Status code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 OK | Request successful. |
| 400 Bad Request | Problem with the request. |
| 401 Unauthorized | Valid channel access token is not specified. |
| 403 Forbidden | Not authorized to access the resource. Confirm that your account or plan is authorized to access the resource. |
| 404 Not Found | Unable to get profile information. Consider these reasons:<ul><li>Target user ID doesn't exist.</li><li>The user hasn't consented to their profile information being obtained.</li><li>The user hasn't added the target LINE Official Account as a friend.</li><li>The user blocked the target LINE Official Account after adding it as a friend.</li></ul>For more information, see [Consent on getting user profile information](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/user-consent/) in the Messaging API documentation. |
| 409 Conflict | An API request with the same retry key has already been accepted. For details, see [Retry failed API request](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/retrying-api-request/). |
| 410 Gone | Access to the resource that is no longer available. |
| 413 Payload Too Large | Request exceeds the max size of 2MB. Make the request smaller than 2MB and try again. |
| 415 Unsupported Media Type | Media type of the uploaded file is unsupported. |
| 429 Too Many Requests | <ul><li>Exceeded the [rate limit](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#rate-limits) for requests.</li><li>Exceeded the [Limit on the number of concurrent operations](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#limit-on-the-number-of-concurrent-operations) for requests.</li><li>Exceeded the number of free messages.</li><li>Exceeded your maximum number of additional messages allowed to be sent.</li></ul>For more information about the number of free messages and the maximum number of additional messages allowed to be sent, see [Messaging API pricing](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/pricing/) in the Messaging API documentation. |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Error on the internal server. |

### Response headers 

The following HTTP headers are included in Messaging API responses:

| Response headers | Description |
| --- | --- |
| X-Line-Request-Id | Request ID. An ID is issued for each request. |
| X-Line-Accepted-Request-Id Not always included | If the request has already been accepted using the same retry key, the `x-line-request-id` of the accepted request is shown. For more information, see [Retrying an API request](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#retry-api-request). |

### Error responses 

The following JSON data is returned in the response body when an error occurs.

<!-- parameter start -->

#### Error messages 

The main error messages that are found in the `message` property of the JSON error responses are shown below.

| Message | Description |
| --- | --- |
| The request body has X error(s) | An error was found in the JSON data of the request body. The number of errors is displayed for "X". Further details are shown in the `details[].message` and `details[].property` properties. |
| Invalid reply token | The reply token specified in `replyToken` to [send reply message](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#send-reply-message) is invalid.

### Other common specifications 

#### About the encoding of a URL specified in a request body property 

Domain names, paths, query parameters, and fragments in the property should be [percent-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) using UTF-8.

For example, if you specify a URI with the following components, it should be `https://example.com/path?q=Good%20morning#Good%20afternoon`.

| Scheme | Domain name | Path | Query parameter | Fragment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| https | example.com | /path | q=Good morning | Good afternoon |

## Webhooks 

When an event occurs, such as when a user adds your LINE Official Account as a friend or sends a message, the LINE Platform sends an HTTPS POST request to the webhook URL (bot server).

The webhook URL is configured for each channel in the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/).

<!-- tip start -->

**We recommend that you make the event processing asynchronous**

We recommend that you make the event processing asynchronous so that the processing of HTTP POST requests does not delay the processing of subsequent events.

<!-- tip end -->

<!-- note start -->

**The IP address of the LINE Platform isn't disclosed**

The IP address of the LINE Platform from which the webhook request is sent isn't disclosed. For better security, use [signature validation](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#signature-validation) instead of access control by IP address.

<!-- note end -->

### Request headers 

<!-- parameter start -->

x-line-signature

Used for [signature validation](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#signature-validation)

<!-- parameter end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Request header field names are case insensitive**

Uppercase and lowercase letters in the [Request headers](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#request-headers) field names may change without notice. The bot server that receives the webhook should handle the header field name without case distinction. \*1

| | Before change | After change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header field name example | `X-Line-Signature` | `x-line-signature` |

\*1 [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2)

<!-- note end -->

### Request body 

The request body contains a JSON object with the user ID of a bot that should receive webhook events and an array of [webhook event objects](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#webhook-event-objects).

<!-- parameter start -->

destination

String

User ID of a bot that should receive webhook events. The user ID value is a string that matches the regular expression, `U[0-9a-f]{32}`.

<!-- parameter end -->
<!-- parameter start -->

events

Array

Array of [webhook event objects](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#webhook-event-objects). The LINE Platform may send an empty array that doesn't include a webhook event object to confirm communication.

<!-- parameter end -->

### Response 

The bot server must return status code `200` after it receives the HTTP POST request sent from the LINE Platform.

<!-- note start -->

**Note**

- Even if the bot server fails to receive the HTTP POST request sent from the LINE Platform, the bot server can receive this request again. For more information, see [Redeliver a webhook that failed to be received](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/receiving-messages/#webhook-redelivery).
- The LINE Platform may send an HTTP POST request that doesn't include a webhook event to confirm communication. In this case, send a `200` status code.

  Example HTTP POST request without a webhook event:

  ```json
  {
    "destination": "xxxxxxxxxx",
    "events": []
  }
  ```

<!-- note end -->

### Signature validation 

When the bot server receives a webhook event, verify the signature included in the request header before processing the [webhook event objects](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#webhook-event-objects). This verification step is important to confirm that the webhook came from the LINE Platform and wasn’t tampered with during transmission.

For more information, see [Verify webhook signature](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/verify-webhook-signature/).

```

<!-- tab end -->

</code-tabs>

## Webhook Event Objects 

These are JSON objects containing events generated by the LINE Platform.

Some properties of these event objects may lack a value. Generated event objects don't contain properties without any value.

<!-- tip start -->

**A single webhook may contain multiple webhook event objects**

A webhook sent from the LINE Platform may contain multiple webhook event objects. There is not necessarily one user per webhook. A [message event](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#message-event) from person A and a [follow event](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#follow-event) from person B may be in the same webhook.

Even when you receive a webhook containing multiple event objects, implement it so that the bot server can process it appropriately according to its contents. For more information, see [request body](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#request-body) under Webhook.

<!-- tip end -->

### Common properties 

The following properties are common properties in webhook event objects.

<!-- parameter start -->

type

String

Identifier for the type of event

<!-- parameter end -->
<!-- parameter start -->

mode

String

Channel state.

- `active`: The channel is active. You can send a reply message or push message, etc. from the bot server that received this webhook event.
- `standby`: The channel is waiting. When the channel state is `standby`, the webhook event won't contain a reply token to [send reply message](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#send-reply-message). For more information about the timing of the channel state set to `standby`, see [Get webhook event](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/partner-docs/module/#bot-module-channel-receive-webhook) in the module documentation.

<!-- note start -->

**When the channel state is standby, the bot server shouldn't send any messages**

When the channel state is `standby`, the [module](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/partner-docs/module/) may be replying or otherwise reacting to the content of the received webhook event. Sending messages from the bot while the user and the module are interacting will confuse the user. Therefore, the bot server that received a Webhook event with a `mode` property of `standby` shouldn't send any messages.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- parameter end -->
<!-- parameter start -->

timestamp

Number

UNIX time of the event occurred (in milliseconds). Even in the case of a redelivered webhook, it represents the time the event occurred, not the time it was redelivered.

<!-- note start -->

**Check timestamp if webhook redelivery is enabled**

If [webhook redelivery](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/receiving-messages/#webhook-redelivery) is enabled, the order in which webhook events occur and the order in which they reach the bot server can be different significantly. If this is an issue, check the context by looking at the `timestamp`.

### Unsend event 

Event object for when the user unsends a message.

When a user unsends a sent message, an unsend event is sent to the bot server. When the unsend event is received, we recommend that service providers respect the user's intent to unsend a sent message and handle the message appropriately with the utmost care so that the target message can't be seen or used in the future. For more information, see [Processing on receipt of unsend event](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/receiving-messages/#webhook-unsend-message) in the Messaging API documentation.

## Getting content 

You can get the content that a user has sent to your LINE Official Account by using the message IDs received via the [webhook](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#webhooks).

### Get content 

Endpoint: `GET` `https://api-data.line.me/v2/bot/message/{messageId}/content`

<!-- note start -->

**This domain name is different from that of other endpoints**

The domain name (`api-data.line.me`) of this endpoint is for sending and receiving large amounts of data in the LINE Platform for Messaging API. This domain name differs from that of other endpoints (`api.line.me`).

<!-- note end -->

Gets [images](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#wh-image), [videos](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#wh-video), [audio](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#wh-audio), and [files](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#wh-file) sent by users using message IDs received via the webhook.

This endpoint is only available if the `contentProvider.type` property of [webhook event objects](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#webhook-event-objects) is `line`.

When a user sends a large video or audio file, it may take some time until the preparation to get the binary data of the content is completed. If you try to get the content while the binary data is being prepared, the status code `202` will be returned and you can't get the binary data. You can use the [Verify the preparation status of a video or audio for getting](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#verify-video-or-audio-preparation-status) endpoint to verify whether or not binary data can be obtained.

Content sent by users may be transformed internally, such as shrinking.

<!-- note start -->

**No API for retrieving text**

You can get the text sent by the user via the [text](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#wh-text) message object of the webhook. There is no API to get the text sent by users again after receiving the webhook.

## Message 

You can send a message and obtain information about the sent message.

### Send reply message 

Endpoint: `POST` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply`

Sends a reply message in response to an event from a user, group chat, or multi-person chat. To send reply messages, you need a reply token which is included in the webhook event object.

When an event occurs, you'll be notified by a [webhook](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#webhooks). If the event can be responded to, the reply token is issued.

<!-- tip start -->

**You can display loading animations while preparing a reply message**

After your LINE Official Account receives a message from a user, the response may takes some time due to message preparation or reservation processing. In such cases, you can visually tell the user that you want them to wait by displaying a loading animation. For more information, see [Display a loading animation](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/use-loading-indicator/) in the Messaging API documentation.

<!-- tip end -->

#### Reply token 

When using reply tokens, check the following:

- Reply tokens can only be used once.
- Reply tokens must be used within one minute after receiving the webhook. Use beyond one minute isn't guaranteed to work.
- Reply tokens included in redelivered webhooks can also be used within one minute after receiving the redelivered webhook. However, the reply token can't be used in the following cases:
  - The reply token included in the original webhook has already been used.
  - 20 minutes have passed since the event occurred.

<!-- note start -->

**Reply tokens should be used as soon as possible**

The time limit for reply tokens is subject to change without notice. In addition, the actual duration of use may vary due to network delays and other factors.

For this reason, don't rely on the time limit for implementation. Also, use reply tokens as soon as possible.

<!-- note end -->

_Example request_

<code-tabs>

<!-- tab start `shell` -->

```sh
curl -v -X POST https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply \

### Send multicast message 

Endpoint: `POST` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/multicast`

An API that efficiently sends the same message to multiple user IDs. You can't send messages to group chats or multi-person chats.

It is also possible to send a multicast message to one user. However, we recommend using [push message](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#send-push-message) when the recipient is only one user. Push message is suitable for sending a message for the purpose of low latency.

#### Conditions for sending multicast message 

You can send a multicast message to users who have added your LINE Official Account as a friend.

When you send a multicast message to these users, status code `200` will be returned, but the users won't receive the message:

- Users who deleted their LINE accounts
- Users who blocked your LINE Official Account from which the multicast message was sent
- Users who haven't added your LINE Official Account as a friend
- User IDs that don't exist in the channel such as those that were taken from another channel under a different provider

Sends a message to multiple users. You can specify recipients using attributes (such as age, gender, OS, and region) or by retargeting (audiences). Messages can't be sent to group chats or multi-person chats.

Narrowcast messages are sent asynchronously in the background after the LINE Platform receives the request. Therefore, even if a request to send a narrowcast message is successful, failures can occur once the message starts to be delivered. You can verify if the message was sent successfully by [getting the progress of the narrowcast message](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-narrowcast-progress-status).

**About sending narrowcast messages to users under the age of 20 in Thailand**

When you filter recipients by certain conditions, users under the age of 20 in Thailand will be excluded.

<!-- note end -->

#### Conditions for sending narrowcast message 

You can send a narrowcast message to users who have added your LINE Official Account as a friend.

If you send a narrowcast message to the following users, status code `202` will be returned, but the users will be excluded from recipients:

- Users who deleted their LINE accounts
- Users who blocked your LINE Official Account
- Users who haven't added your LINE Official Account as a friend
- User IDs that don't exist in the channel such as those that were taken from another channel under a different provider

#### Restrictions on sending messages using attributes and audiences 

When using attributes or audiences, restrictions to protect the user's privacy may apply to the sent message, depending on the conditions of sending. If the sent message meets the restrictions, an error will occur when sending a request or delivering a message.

- To specify attribute data as a condition of sending, your LINE Official Account's [target reach](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#target-reach) number must be 100 people or more. Returns a `403` HTTP status code if your target reach is less than 100 people.
- When you specify attribute data or audiences (\*) as a condition of sending, the final number of recipients must be 50 or more. The `202` HTTP status code will be also returned if the final number of recipients is less than 50 people, but an error will occur when message delivery starts.
- When you specify more than one audience as a condition of sending, each audience (\*) must have at least 50 recipients. The `202` HTTP status code will be also returned if the audience has less than 50 recipients, but an error will occur when message delivery starts.

\* The following audiences have no restrictions regarding the number of recipients. However, for audiences created by other LINE Official Account, the restrictions apply even to the following audiences:

- Audiences created by uploading user IDs from LINE Official Account Manager or the Messaging API
- Chat tag audiences

#### Note regarding the number of remaining messages to be sent during the current month 

In LINE Official Account Manager and the Messaging API, the number of messages scheduled to be sent will be reserved for the remaining messages until the number of messages to be sent is determined after the sending messages is started. If the number of messages scheduled to be sent can't be reserved at the start of the message delivery, the message will fail to deliver.

Narrowcast messages require reservations for the target reach of the LINE Official Account, regardless of the actual number of recipients. Therefore, when sending narrowcast messages, take note of the following:

- If the number of remaining messages that can be sent during the current month is less than the target reach of your LINE Official Account, an error will occur when starting to deliver narrowcast messages.
- Even though the actual number of recipients is sufficiently small, the number of remaining messages for the current month may be temporarily depleted, making it impossible to send other messages during the delivery of narrowcast messages.

You may be able to avoid these situations by limiting the number of messages to send when sending a narrowcast message. For more information, see [Limit objects](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#send-narrowcast-limit) on the [Request body](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#send-narrowcast-request-body).

##### Limit objects 

You can set a limit on the maximum number of narrowcast messages that can be sent by setting limit objects.

For more information on controlling the maximum number of sending through property settings, see [Controlling the maximum number of messages to send with limit objects](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/sending-messages/#maximum-send-numbers-control) in the Messaging API documentation.

<!-- parameter start (props: optional) -->

max

Number

The maximum number of narrowcast messages to send. Use this parameter to limit the number of narrowcast messages sent. The recipients will be chosen at random.

<!-- parameter end -->
<!-- parameter start (props: optional) -->

upToRemainingQuota

Boolean

If `true`, the message will be sent within the maximum number of deliverable messages. The default value is `false`. Targets will be selected at random.

<!-- parameter end -->
<!-- parameter start (props: optional) -->

forbidPartialDelivery

Boolean

This option prevents messages from being delivered to only a subset of the target audience. When you set the `upToRemainingQuota` property to `true` and also set the `forbidPartialDelivery` property to `true`, the message will not be delivered if the number of recipients exceeds the maximum number of sending.

You can check whether message delivery was canceled by [retrieving the narrowcast message progress](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-narrowcast-progress-status). If delivery is canceled, the `phase` property in the response will be `failed`, and the `errorCode` property will be `5`.

The `forbidPartialDelivery` property can only be specified if the `upToRemainingQuota` property is set to `true`.

<!-- parameter end -->

_Example limit object_

<code-tabs>

<!-- tab start `json` -->

```json
{
  "max": 100,
  "upToRemainingQuota": true,
  "forbidPartialDelivery": true
}
```

<!-- tab end -->

</code-tabs>

This table shows the relationship between the `max` property settings and `upToRemainingQuota` property settings, and the number of reservations and the maximum number of sending.

| `max` property | `upToRemainingQuota` property | Number of reservation and maximum number of sending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not set | false | Number of target reach |
| Any number | false | Minimum value from target reach and `max` property |
| Not set | true | Minimum value from target reach and estimated upper limit for the current month |
| Any number | true | Minimum value from target reach, estimated upper limit for the current month, and `max` property |

#### Response 

Returns the `202` HTTP status code and an empty JSON object.

Narrowcast messages are sent asynchronously. For more information on how to check the status of a narrowcast message, see [Get narrowcast message status](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-narrowcast-progress-status).

#### Response 

Returns a `200` HTTP status code and a JSON object with the following information.

<!-- parameter start -->

phase

String

The current status. One of:

- `waiting`: Messages are not yet ready to be sent. They are currently being filtered or processed in some way.
- `sending`: Messages are currently being sent.
- `succeeded`: Messages were sent successfully. This may not mean the messages were successfully received.
- `failed`: Messages failed to be sent. Use the `failedDescription` property to find the cause of the failure.

<!-- parameter end -->
<!-- parameter start (props: annotation="Not always included") -->

targetCount

Number

The number of intended recipients of the message. \*

<!-- parameter end -->

### Retrying an API request 

By including a retry key (`X-Line-Retry-Key`) in the HTTP header of a push message, multicast message, narrowcast message, or broadcast message, the same API request can be reattempted to prevent duplicate processing.

The retry key management period on the LINE Platform side is 24 hours. If you use the same retry key for more than 24 hours, the request will be treated as a new API request.

For more information on retrying an API request, see [Retry failed API requests](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/retrying-api-request/) in the Messaging API documentation.

<!-- note start -->

**Don't use the same retry key for more than 24 hours**

If you use the same retry key for more than 24 hours, the request will succeed as a new API request even if an API request containing the same retry key has already succeeded. As a result, duplicate messages will be sent.

<!-- note end -->

_Example request_

<code-tabs>

<!-- tab start `shell` -->

```sh
curl -v -X POST https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/push \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

## Managing Audience 

You can create, update, activate, or delete an audience. Specify the audience when sending narrowcast messages.

Audiences can also be created using [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/). To learn more, see [Audience](https://www.lycbiz.com/jp/manual/OfficialAccountManager/messages-audience/) in LINE for Business.

### Details of the error related to audience management 

The details of the error that occurs on the Managing Audience endpoints are included in the `details[].message` property of the JSON response. The details of the main error are as follows:

| Message | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AUDIENCE_GROUP_CAN_NOT_UPLOAD_STATUS_EXPIRED` | This audience can't be used because it's been more than 180 days (15,552,000 seconds) since this audience was created. |
| `AUDIENCE_GROUP_COUNT_MAX_OVER` | You have already created the maximum number of audiences (1,000). |
| `AUDIENCE_GROUP_NAME_SIZE_OVER` | The audience's name is too long. |
| `AUDIENCE_GROUP_NAME_WRONG` | The audience's name contains an invalid character (such as `\n` or some other control character). |
| `AUDIENCE_GROUP_NAME_EMPTY` | The audience's name is empty or contains only spaces. |
| `AUDIENCE_GROUP_NOT_FOUND` | Audience not found. |

| `AUDIENCE_GROUP_UPLOAD_DESCRIPTION_SIZE_OVER` | The audience's description is too long. |
| `REQUEST_NOT_FOUND` | The specified request ID is incorrect or LINE not ready to create an audience with the specified request ID. |
| `TOO_OLD_MESSAGES` | You can't create an audience for a message (request ID) that was sent over 60 days (5,184,000 seconds) ago. |
| `UPLOAD_AUDIENCE_GROUP_INVALID_AUDIENCE_ID_FORMAT` | <ul><li>`file` contains an invalid user ID or IFA.</li><li>`audiences[].id` is an invalid user ID or IFA.</li></ul>If this message is returned, see [Error-handling methods](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#manage-audience-error-handling). |
| `UPLOAD_AUDIENCE_GROUP_NO_VALID_AUDIENCE_IDS` | <ul><li>`file` doesn't contain a valid user ID or IFA.</li><li>`audiences[].id` isn't a valid user ID or IFA.</li></ul> |
| `UPLOAD_AUDIENCE_GROUP_TOO_MANY_AUDIENCE_IDS` | Exceeded the maximum number of user IDs or IFAs. |
| `WRONG_BOT_ID` | The bot ID in the specified request ID doesn't match the bot linked to the channel that issued the channel access token. |
| `ALREADY_ACTIVE` | The audience group is already active. |

#### Error-handling methods 

<!-- note start -->

**If the audiences property contains invalid user IDs**

In the case that `UPLOAD_AUDIENCE_GROUP_INVALID_AUDIENCE_ID_FORMAT` is returned, use the [Get profile information](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-profile) endpoint to get profile information of all user IDs specified in JSON. After excluding all user IDs that return anything other than status code `200`, execute the failed endpoint once again.

<!-- note end -->

### Create audience for uploading user IDs (by JSON) 

Endpoint: `POST` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/audienceGroup/upload`

Creates an audience for uploading user IDs.

For this endpoint, use JSON to specify recipients. You can also use [Endpoint that specifies recipients with text file](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#create-upload-audience-group-by-file).

For more information on how to get user IDs, see [Get user IDs](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/getting-user-ids/) in the Messaging API documentation.

#### Conditions for users that can be added to the audience 

You can add users who are friends with your LINE Official Account to an audience for uploading user IDs. Even if status code `202` is returned, these users are added to the audience.

- Users who deleted their LINE accounts
- Users who blocked your LINE Official Account that created the audience
- Users who haven't added your LINE Official Account that created the audience as a friend

If you send a message using the created audience, the message won't be sent to the users listed above.

<!-- note start -->

**We have set a limit on the number of concurrent endpoint operations**

We have set a limit on the number of concurrent endpoint operations per audience ID (`audienceGroupId`), for creating an audience for uploading user IDs and adding user IDs to an audience. For more information, see [Limit on the number of concurrent operations](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#limit-on-the-number-of-concurrent-operations).

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**You must complete additional application forms to specify recipients using Identifiers for Advertisers (IFAs)**

You can use IFAs to specify recipients, but this feature is only available to corporate users who have completed certain applications. To use it with your LINE Official Account, contact your sales representative or contact [our Sales partners](https://www.lycbiz.com/jp/partner/sales/).

<!-- note end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**Audience used for uploading user IDs**

Audience specifications are as follows:

| Item | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| The number of audiences per channel | Max limit: 1,000 |
| Retention period of an audience | Up to 180 days (15,552,000 seconds) |
| The number of user IDs or IFAs you can upload to an audience per request | When using JSON: Max limit: 10,000<br>When using file: Max limit: 1,500,000 |
| The number of users per audience | Audience for uploading user IDs: No limit |

For information on narrowcast message restrictions, see [Restrictions on sending messages using attributes and audiences](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#send-narrowcast-message-restrictions).

<!-- tip end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Verifying a valid user ID**

If an invalid user ID is specified in the `audiences` property of JSON, the error response (`details[].message`: `UPLOAD_AUDIENCE_GROUP_INVALID_AUDIENCE_ID_FORMAT`) will be returned, and adding a user ID will fail. Before you execute this endpoint, check whether all the user IDs specified in the `audiences` property of JSON are valid.

To confirm whether a user ID is valid, use the [Get profile information](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-profile) endpoint. If the user ID is valid, HTTP status code `200` will be returned. If a value other than `200` is returned, the user ID is invalid and should not be included in the `audiences` property.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Status of an audience without a user ID**

If the `audiences` property is omitted or an empty array is specified in the JSON when creating an audience, an empty audience will be created.

The number of users included in the audience (`audienceGroup.audienceCount`) of an empty audience is 0 and the audience can't accept messages. Therefore, the `audienceGroup.status` in the response remains `IN_PROGRESS` and doesn't become `READY`.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Only users who have agreed to the LY Corporation Privacy Policy (revised March 2022) will be added**

When adding user IDs to an audience for uploading user IDs, if the user IDs include those of users who haven't agreed to [the privacy policy (revised March 2022)](https://guide.line.me/privacy-policy_update/2022/0001/?lang=en-jp), users who haven't agreed will be ignored and only users who have agreed will be added.

Therefore, the number of valid recipients of the audience may be less than that of user IDs specified.

### Add user IDs or Identifiers for Advertisers (IFAs) to an audience for uploading user IDs (by JSON) 

Endpoint: `PUT` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/audienceGroup/upload`

Adds new user IDs or IFAs to an audience for uploading user IDs.

For this endpoint, use JSON to specify recipients. You can also use [Endpoint that specifies recipients with text file](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#update-upload-audience-group-by-file).

#### Conditions for users that can be added to the audience 

You can add users who are friends with your LINE Official Account to an audience for uploading user IDs. Even if status code `202` is returned, these users are added to the audience.

- Users who deleted their LINE accounts
- Users who blocked your LINE Official Account that created the audience
- Users who haven't added your LINE Official Account that created the audience as a friend

If you send a message using the created audience, the message won't be sent to the users listed above.

<!-- note start -->

**We have set a limit on the number of concurrent endpoint operations**

We have set a limit on the number of concurrent endpoint operations per audience ID (`audienceGroupId`), for creating an audience for uploading user IDs and adding user IDs to an audience. For more information, see [Limit on the number of concurrent operations](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#limit-on-the-number-of-concurrent-operations).

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Request timeout values**

We strongly recommend using request timeout values of 30 seconds or more.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Verifying a valid user ID**

If an invalid user ID is specified in the `audiences` property of JSON, the error response (`details[].message`: `UPLOAD_AUDIENCE_GROUP_INVALID_AUDIENCE_ID_FORMAT`) will be returned, and audience creation will fail. Before you execute this endpoint, check whether all the user IDs specified in the `audiences` property of JSON are valid.

To confirm whether a user ID is valid, use the [Get profile information](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-profile) endpoint. If the user ID is valid, HTTP status code `200` will be returned. If a value other than `200` is returned, the user ID is invalid and should not be included in the `audiences` property.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**You can't switch between user IDs and IFAs**

Add the same type of data (user IDs or IFAs) to an audience for uploading user IDs as you originally specified when creating that audience. For example, you can't add user IDs to an audience that originally used IFAs when it was created.

You can use an audience's `isIfaAudience` property to determine which type of recipient (user IDs or IFAs) was specified when the audience was created. For more details, see [Get audience data](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-audience-group).

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**You can't delete user IDs or IFAs**

You cannot delete a user ID or IFA after adding it.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Only users who have agreed to the LY Corporation Privacy Policy (revised March 2022) will be added**

When adding user IDs to an audience for uploading user IDs, if the user IDs include those of users who haven't agreed to [the privacy policy (revised March 2022)](https://guide.line.me/privacy-policy_update/2022/0001/?lang=en-jp), users who haven't agreed will be ignored and only users who have agreed will be added.

Therefore, the number of valid recipients of the audience may be less than that of user IDs specified.

### Add user IDs or Identifiers for Advertisers (IFAs) to an audience for uploading user IDs (by file) 

Endpoint: `PUT` `https://api-data.line.me/v2/bot/audienceGroup/upload/byFile`

<!-- note start -->

**This domain name is different from that of other endpoints**

The domain name (`api-data.line.me`) of this endpoint is for sending and receiving large amounts of data in the LINE Platform for Messaging API. This domain name differs from that of other endpoints (`api.line.me`).

<!-- note end -->

Adds new user IDs or IFAs to an audience for uploading user IDs.

For this endpoint, use a text file to specify recipients. You can also use [Endpoint that specifies recipients with JSON](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#update-upload-audience-group).

#### Conditions for users that can be added to the audience 

You can add users who are friends with your LINE Official Account to an audience for uploading user IDs. Even if status code `202` is returned, these users are added to the audience.

- Users who deleted their LINE accounts
- Users who blocked your LINE Official Account that created the audience
- Users who haven't added your LINE Official Account that created the audience as a friend

If you send a message using the created audience, the message won't be sent to the users listed above.

<!-- note start -->

**We have set a limit on the number of concurrent endpoint operations**

We have set a limit on the number of concurrent endpoint operations per audience ID (`audienceGroupId`), for creating an audience for uploading user IDs and adding user IDs to an audience. For more information, see [Limit on the number of concurrent operations](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#limit-on-the-number-of-concurrent-operations).

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Request timeout values**

We strongly recommend using request timeout values of 30 seconds or more.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**You can't switch between user IDs and IFAs**

Add the same type of data (user IDs or IFAs) to an audience for uploading user IDs as you originally specified when creating that audience. For example, you can't add user IDs to an audience that originally used IFAs when it was created.

You can use an audience's `isIfaAudience` property to determine which type of recipient (user IDs or IFAs) was specified when the audience was created. For more details, see [Get audience data](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-audience-group).

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**You can't delete user IDs or IFAs**

You cannot delete a user ID or IFA after adding it.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Only users who have agreed to the LY Corporation Privacy Policy (revised March 2022) will be added**

When adding user IDs to an audience for uploading user IDs, if the user IDs include those of users who haven't agreed to [the privacy policy (revised March 2022)](https://guide.line.me/privacy-policy_update/2022/0001/?lang=en-jp), users who haven't agreed will be ignored and only users who have agreed will be added.

Therefore, the number of valid recipients of the audience may be less than that of user IDs specified.

### Get friend demographics 

Endpoint: `GET` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/insight/demographic`

Retrieves the friend demographic information of the friends of the LINE Official Account. To retrieve the friend demographic information, all of the following conditions must be met:

- The target reach is 20 or more people.
- The LINE Official Account was created by a user in Japan (JP), Thailand (TH) or Taiwan (TW).

<!-- note start -->

**Not real-time data**

It takes approximately 3 days for the friend demographic information to be reflected. Therefore, the information that can be obtained will be approximately 3 days old. Note that the timing may vary.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**About friend demographic information**

Friend demographic information is classified as "deemed attributes" based on the gender, age, area information, and action history registered by LINE users in the LINE Family service. Mobile carriers and operating systems aren't included in the deemed attributes.

Deemed Attributes are classified based on trends such as stickers purchased and used on LINE, content of interest, and the types of LINE Official Accounts that users are friends with. Sensitive information such as phone numbers, email addresses, address books, and chat content isn't included in the information used as the basis for classification.

The estimation of friend demographic information is statistical and doesn't identify specific individuals. Information that could identify specific individuals isn't shared with third parties (e.g., advertisers).

<!-- tip end -->

_Example request_

<code-tabs>

<!-- tab start `shell` -->

```sh
curl -v -X GET https://api.line.me/v2/bot/insight/demographic \

#### Error response 

For more information, see [Status codes](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#status-codes) and [Error responses](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#error-responses) in the [Common specifications](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#common-specifications) section.

### Get statistics per unit 

Endpoint: `GET` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/insight/message/event/aggregation?customAggregationUnit={customAggregationUnit}&from={from}&to={to}`

You can check the per-unit statistics of how users interact with push messages and multicast messages sent from your LINE Official Account.

You can get statistics on a per-message and per-message bubble basis for each unit.

![message and bubbles](https://developers.line.biz/media/messaging-api/get-message-event.png)

If you send messages with the same unit name, the statistics are aggregated together, regardless of message contents or the number and order of message bubbles.

<!-- note start -->

**On recorded statistics**

Interactions are updated for only 14 days (1,209,600 seconds) from the time a message was sent. After that time, interactions aren't updated.

For example, if you send a message at 15:00 on February 1, 2021, interactions will be updated until 15:00 on February 15, 2021.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**To get statistics per message**

Use this endpoint to get statistics per narrowcast message or broadcast message.

### Get a list of users who added your LINE Official Account as a friend 

Endpoint: `GET` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/followers/ids`

<!-- note start -->

**Note**

This feature is available only for verified or [premium accounts](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#premium-account). For more information about account types, see the [Account Types of LINE Official Account](https://www.linebiz.com/jp-en/service/line-official-account/account-type/) page on LINE for Business.

<!-- note end -->

Gets the list of [User IDs](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#user-id) of users who have added your LINE Official Account as a friend.

To get all the user IDs, you need to repeat the request until the `next` property is no longer included in the [response](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-follower-ids-response). Repeat the request by specifying the `next` property included in the response as `start` of the next request.

#### Restrictions on user IDs that can be obtained 

These users' IDs won't be included in the obtained list of user IDs:

- Users who deleted their LINE accounts.
- Users who blocked your LINE Official Account after adding it as a friend.
- Users who haven't consented to their profile information being obtained. For more information, see [Consent on getting user profile information](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/user-consent/) in the Messaging API documentation.

Therefore, the actual number of user IDs obtained with this endpoint may not be consistent with the number of friends displayed on your LINE Official Account business profile or [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/).

<!-- note start -->

**You may not be able to use the user IDs obtained**

Even if you send messages to the user IDs obtained with this endpoint, delivery may fail depending on user action. These are the main reasons for failure:

- User blocked the target LINE Official Account between the time the user ID was obtained and the time you attempted to send a message.
- User [deleted LINE account](https://guide.line.me/ja/account-and-settings/account-and-profile/line-account-delete.html) after adding the target LINE Official Account as a friend.

For more information, see [Status codes](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#status-codes) and [Error responses](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#error-responses) in the [Common specifications](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#common-specifications) section.

## Per-user rich menu 

You can set the rich menu on a per-user basis by specifying the user ID and the rich menu ID. For more information, see [Use per-user rich menus](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/use-per-user-rich-menus/) in the Messaging API documentation.

### Link rich menu to user 

Endpoint: `POST` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/user/{userId}/richmenu/{richMenuId}`

Links a rich menu to a user. Only one rich menu can be linked to a user at one time. If a user already has a rich menu linked, calling this endpoint replaces the existing rich menu with the one specified in your request.

The rich menu is displayed in the following order of priority (highest to lowest):

1. The per-user rich menu set with the Messaging API
1. The [default rich menu set with the Messaging API](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#set-default-rich-menu)
1. The [default rich menu set with LINE Official Account Manager](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/rich-menus-overview/#creating-a-rich-menu-with-the-line-manager)

#### Conditions for linking rich menu 

You can link a rich menu to users who have added your LINE Official Account as a friend.

If you try to link a rich menu to the following users, status code `200` will be returned, but the rich menu won't be linked to the user:

- Users who deleted their LINE accounts
- Users who blocked your LINE Official Account
- Users who haven't added your LINE Official Account as a friend
- User IDs that don't exist in the channel such as those that were taken from another channel under a different provider

### Link rich menu to multiple users 

Endpoint: `POST` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/richmenu/bulk/link`

Links a rich menu to multiple users.

The rich menu is displayed in the following order of priority (highest to lowest):

1. The per-user rich menu set with the Messaging API
1. The [default rich menu set with the Messaging API](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#set-default-rich-menu)
1. The [default rich menu set with LINE Official Account Manager](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/rich-menus-overview/#creating-a-rich-menu-with-the-line-manager)

Unlike [linking a rich menu to a user](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#link-rich-menu-to-user), this request is processed asynchronously in the background. Normally, the process is completed within a few seconds.

Even if the status code `202` is returned, the rich menu may not be linked. To verify whether the request was processed successfully, [get the rich menu ID linked to the users](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-rich-menu-id-of-user) and check if the rich menu is actually linked to the users.

The rich menu isn't linked to any user if an [error response](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#bulk-link-rich-menu-error-response) is returned.

#### Conditions for linking rich menu 

You can link a rich menu to users who have added your LINE Official Account as a friend. If status code `202` is returned, the rich menu is linked to the users specified in the request.

Even if status code `202` is returned, the following users may not be linked to the rich menu because they aren't friends with your LINE Official Account:

- Users who deleted their LINE accounts
- Users who blocked your LINE Official Account
- Users who haven't added your LINE Official Account as a friend
- User IDs that don't exist in the channel such as those that were taken from another channel under a different provider

### Unlink rich menus from multiple users 

Endpoint: `POST` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/richmenu/bulk/unlink`

Unlinks rich menus from multiple users.

Unlike [unlinking a rich menu from a user](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#unlink-rich-menu-from-user), this request is processed asynchronously in the background. Normally, the process is completed within a few seconds.

Even if status code `202` is returned, the rich menu may not be unlinked. To verify whether the request was processed successfully, [get the rich menu ID linked to the users](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-rich-menu-id-of-user) and check if the unlinked rich menus are actually not linked to the users.

The rich menu isn't unlinked from any user if an [error response](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#bulk-unlink-rich-menu-error-response) is returned.

#### Conditions for unlinking rich menu 

You can unlink a rich menu from users who have added your LINE Official Account as a friend. If status code `202` is returned, the rich menu is unlinked from the users specified in the request.

Even if status code `202` is returned, the following users may not be unlinked from the rich menu because they aren't friends with your LINE Official Account:

### Replace or unlink the linked rich menus in batches 

Endpoint: `POST` `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/richmenu/batch`

You can use this endpoint to batch control the rich menu linked to the users using the endpoint such as [Link rich menu to user](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#link-rich-menu-to-user). The following operations are available:

1. Replace a rich menu with another rich menu for all users linked to a specific rich menu.
1. Unlink a rich menu for all users linked to a specific rich menu.
1. Unlink a rich menu for all users linked the rich menu.

You can also specify multiple rich menu batch operations in the `operations` property of the [request body](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#batch-control-rich-menus-of-users-request-body). If you specify multiple rich menu batch operations, each batch operation is processed independently and in parallel for each user. The batch operations you specify don't affect each other.

For example, if you specify the following array for the `operations` property, the rich menu for users who were linked to rich menu A before the request will be replaced with B, and the rich menu for users who were linked to rich menu B before the request will be replaced with C. The rich menu for users who were linked to rich menu A before the request won't be replaced with C because batch operations don't affect each other.

```json
[
  {
    "type": "link",
    "from": "{ID of rich menu A}",
    "to": "{ID of rich menu B}"
  },
  {
    "type": "link",
    "from": "{ID of rich menu B}",
    "to": "{ID of rich menu C}"
  }
]
```

Batch operation of the rich menu is processed asynchronously in the background. You can check the status of the process by using the [Get the status of rich menu batch control](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-batch-control-rich-menus-progress-status) endpoint.

#### How to avoid unintended operations when retrying 

By using the `resumeRequestKey` property, you can safely retry.

If you retry without using the `resumeRequestKey` property in the following cases, the rich menu may be replaced with an unintended one.

- If you're not sure whether your request was accepted due to a timeout or an internal server error of the LINE Platform
- If you [get rich menu batch operation progress status](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-batch-control-rich-menus-progress-status) and the `phase` property of response is `failed`

Even under these conditions, if you specify an arbitrary key in the `resumeRequestKey` property on your first request, sending the request again with the same key will only resume processing for users who haven't completed processing.

The `resumeRequestKey` property expires in 14 days (336 hours). If it has expired, the request will be treated as a new request.

_Example of a request to replace a rich menu and unlink a rich menu_

#### How to configure an image 

Images used in imagemap messages must meet the following requirements:

- Image format: JPEG or PNG
- Image width: 240px, 300px, 460px, 700px, 1040px
- Max file size: 10 MB

<!-- tip start -->

**Using transparent PNG**

It is possible to use transparent PNG in your imagemap messages.

<!-- tip end -->

Make it possible to access images of 5 different sizes using the `baseUrl/{image width}` URL format. LINE will then download an image at the appropriate resolution based on the device.

For example, if we had a base URL of `https://example.com/images/cats`, the URL for the image with a width of 700px would be `https://example.com/images/cats/700`. To confirm all images display properly, access the image URLs.

| Image width | Example URL |
| --- | --- |
| 240px | `https://example.com/bot/images/rm001/240` |
| 300px | `https://example.com/bot/images/rm001/300` |
| 460px | `https://example.com/bot/images/rm001/460` |
| 700px | `https://example.com/bot/images/rm001/700` |
| 1040px | `https://example.com/bot/images/rm001/1040` |

<!-- note start -->

**Exclude image extension from URL**

Don't include the extension in the image filename. The image will not display in the imagemap message if the URL contains the image file extension (e.g. `https://example.com/bot/images/rm001/700.png`).

<!-- note end -->

#### Imagemap action objects 

Object which specifies the actions and tappable areas of an imagemap. When an area is tapped, the following actions are triggered for each type of action:

- `uri`: The user is redirected to the specified URI.
- `message`: The specified message is sent.
- `clipboard`: The specified string is copied to the user's device clipboard.

_Image example_

<code-tabs>

<!-- tab start `json` -->

```json
{

###### About the drawing area 

Specify the max width of the image with the `size` property and the aspect ratio (width-to-height ratio) of the image with the `aspectRatio` property. The rectangular area determined by the `size` and `aspectRatio` properties is called the **drawing area**. The image is rendered in this drawing area.

- If the image width specified by the `flex` property is larger than that calculated from the [`size` property](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/flex-message-layout/#component-size), the width of the drawing area is scaled down to the width of the component.
- If the aspect ratio of the image and that specified by the `aspectRatio` property do not match, the image is displayed according to the `aspectMode` property. The default value is `fit`.
  - If the value of `aspectMode` is `cover`: The image fills the entire drawing area. Parts of the image that do not fit in the drawing area are not displayed.
  - If the value of `aspectMode` is `fit`: The entire image is displayed in the drawing area. A background is displayed in the unused areas to the left and right of vertical images and in the areas above and below horizontal images.

##### Video 

This component renders a video.

<!-- note start -->

**If the video doesn't play properly**

Even if a message that contains a video is successfully sent, the video may not play properly on the user's device. For more information, see [Why can't I play a video that I sent as a message?](https://developers.line.biz/en/faq/#why-cant-i-play-a-video-i-sent) in the FAQ.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Video aspect ratio**

A very wide or tall video may be cropped when played in some environments.

Also, the aspect ratio of the video specified in the `url` property and the following two aspect ratios should be the same. If these aspect ratios are different, the layout may result in an unexpected layout:

- The aspect ratio specified by the `aspectRatio` property
- The aspect ratio of the preview image specified by the `previewUrl` property

![A video in a LINE chat room. A preview image with a 1:1 aspect ratio is displayed behind the video that has an aspect ratio of 16:9.](https://developers.line.biz/media/messaging-api/messages/image-overlapping-en.png)
